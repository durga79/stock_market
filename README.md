# Financial Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project analyzes financial risk through three interconnected approaches:
- **Member 1**: Stock market volatility prediction using SVM and Naive Bayes
- **Member 2**: Financial news sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression and KNN
- **Member 3**: Macroeconomic risk classification using Decision Tree and LDA

## Datasets
All datasets contain 15,000+ rows and are temporally aligned:
- `market_data.csv`: Daily stock market indicators (OHLCV, Movement)
- `news_data.csv`: Financial news headlines with sentiment labels
- `macro_data.csv`: Economic indicators (GDP, Inflation, Unemployment, Risk Class)

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Generate datasets: `python src/data_generator.py`
3. Open notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/COMPLETE_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS.ipynb`

## Methodology
This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology with comprehensive documentation of:
- Business Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment considerations

## Deliverables
- Main Jupyter Notebook with all analyses
- IEEE format research paper (8-10 pages)
- 10-minute presentation
- Complete code and datasets package
